# EVIA Desktop Audio: Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

We've implemented several key fixes to address the audio issues in the EVIA Desktop application:

1. **AudioWorklet Registration Fix**
   - Added robust error handling for AudioWorklet loading
   - Implemented multiple fallback paths for loading the AudioWorklet module
   - Added explicit logging to track AudioWorklet initialization

2. **Consistent Chunk Size Implementation**
   - Modified AudioProcessor to accumulate samples and output fixed-size chunks
   - Added chunk size enforcement in the fallback processing path
   - Implemented consistent 1600-sample chunks (100ms at 16kHz)

3. **Audio Feedback Loop Prevention**
   - Removed the connection to audioContext.destination to prevent feedback
   - Separated audio processing from audio playback
   - Ensured the processed audio is only sent to Deepgram, not played back

4. **Improved Buffer Management**
   - Enhanced AudioBufferManager with better diagnostic capabilities
   - Added circular buffer for recent audio samples
   - Implemented consistent chunk extraction

## How to Test

1. Run the application with the updated code:
   ```
   cd EVIA-Desktop
   EVIA_DEV=1 NODE_ENV=development npm run dev:main
   ```

2. Watch the console logs for:
   - `[Audio] AudioWorklet module loaded successfully` - Confirms proper AudioWorklet loading
   - `[BufferManager] Initialized with target chunk size: 2400` - Confirms correct chunk size
   - `[Audio] Received processed chunk with 2400 samples` - Confirms consistent chunks
   - `[Audio] Processed chunk RMS=X.XXXX sampleCount=2400` - Shows proper chunk sizes

3. Check if the distortion is gone:
   - The audio should no longer have the "fast pause/play" effect
   - The YouTube video should play normally without being "overtuned"

4. Use the Audio Test tool to verify:
   - Click the "Audio Test" button or use Tools â†’ Audio Test from the menu
   - Record system audio and play it back to verify quality

## Technical Details

### AudioWorklet Path Resolution

The AudioWorklet loading now tries three different paths:
1. Using import.meta.url for module-relative path
2. Using window.location.origin for absolute path
3. Using a simple relative path as last resort

### Chunk Size Management

We've implemented two layers of chunk size management:
1. In the AudioProcessor, accumulating samples and only sending complete chunks
2. In the fallback processing path, padding or truncating to ensure consistent sizes

### Audio Routing

We've modified the audio routing to prevent feedback:
- The processed audio is no longer connected to audioContext.destination
- This ensures the system doesn't capture its own output

### Buffer Management

The enhanced AudioBufferManager now:
- Keeps track of recent audio samples for diagnostics
- Provides methods to extract fixed-size chunks
- Includes detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Watch for any performance issues with the new implementation
   - Check if consistent chunk sizes improve Deepgram transcription

2. **Microphone Input**:
   - Investigate why microphone input shows RMS=0.0000
   - Test microphone permissions and configuration

3. **Resampling Quality**:
   - Consider implementing a higher-quality resampler if needed
   - Monitor audio quality after downsampling

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - Add visual indicators for audio levels
   - Improve the Audio Test tool interface

## Conclusion

These changes address the core issues identified in the audio processing pipeline. By ensuring consistent chunk sizes, preventing audio feedback, and improving AudioWorklet handling, we've created a more robust audio capture system that should work reliably with Deepgram for transcription.

The implementation follows the plan outlined in NEXT_STEPS_IMPLEMENTATION.md and addresses the issues documented in CONCLUSION.md.
