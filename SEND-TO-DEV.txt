📍 CURRENT STATE

Frontend Branch: staging-unified-v2 (commit: 129985e)
Backend Branch: backend-mvp-finish (commit: 16a61e9)

🔴 ALL THESE ISSUES ARE BROKEN (NONE WORK):

1. English transcription shows German text
   → Backend NOT using lang parameter from WebSocket URL
   
2. Ask responses in German when set to English  
   → Same issue as #1
   
3. Groq thinks user query is from prospect (not user)
   → Backend prompt doesn't separate transcript from user query
   
4. Transcription stops after a few segments
   → Possible timeout issue
   
5. Singularity animation doesn't happen
   → Settings window can't animate Header (different processes)
   
6. Windows don't close on language toggle
   → Settings window can't close other windows (need IPC)

🎯 PRIORITY:
Issue #1 is CRITICAL - blocks everything else
