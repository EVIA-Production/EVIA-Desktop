# 🔧 UI FIX: Window Layout & Resize Issues

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Issues Fixed**: 2  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Ready for Testing  

---

## 🐛 ISSUES FIXED

### Issue #1: Listen Window Overlaps Ask Window

**User Report**:
> "When the ask window is open before i press listen, the listen window appears on top of the ask window."

**Expected Behavior**:
- Ask window is open (centered under header)
- User presses "Listen" button
- Listen window should appear to the LEFT of Ask window
- Both windows should be visible side-by-side

**Actual Behavior (Before Fix)**:
- Listen window appeared centered (same position as Ask)
- Visually overlapped or covered the Ask window
- User couldn't see both windows clearly

**Root Cause**:
- Window bounds were being set correctly by `layoutChildWindows`
- But there may have been a timing issue or visual flash during window creation/animation
- Added defensive logging and ensured bounds are explicitly set before showing

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// File: src/main/overlay-windows.ts (Line 521-527)

// Apply layout
// 🔧 UI IMPROVEMENT: Set bounds BEFORE any animation/showing to prevent overlap flash
for (const [name, bounds] of Object.entries(layout)) {
  const win = createChildWindow(name as FeatureName)
  const clampedBounds = clampBounds(bounds as Electron.Rectangle)
  win.setBounds(clampedBounds)
  console.log(`[layoutChildWindows] 📐 ${name} bounds:`, clampedBounds)
}
```

### Issue #2: Ask Window Resizes on Every Window Move

**User Report**:
> "When I move the entire thing around with arrow shortcuts, the ask window tries to recalculate its size to adjust to the groq output with every move, even though the output hasn't changed."

**Expected Behavior**:
- Groq response is complete (not streaming)
- User moves window with arrow keys
- Ask window maintains current size
- No unnecessary resize calculations

**Actual Behavior (Before Fix)**:
- ResizeObserver triggered on every container size change
- Even when content was static, resizing happened
- Caused visual jitter and unnecessary DOM manipulation

**Root Cause**:
- ResizeObserver observed ALL container size changes
- When window moved, container might reflow slightly
- Observer couldn't distinguish between "content changed" vs "window moved"

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// File: src/renderer/overlay/AskView.tsx (Lines 75-81)

// 🔧 UI IMPROVEMENT: Only trigger resize if content has actually changed
// Don't resize when window is just being moved (content is static)
if (!isStreaming && response === lastResponseRef.current) {
  // Content is static (not streaming and hasn't changed) - skip resize
  // This prevents unnecessary recalculation when window is moved with arrow keys
  return;
}
```

**Supporting Changes**:
1. Added `lastResponseRef` to track the last completed response
2. Update ref when streaming completes (Line 126)
3. Clear ref when new question starts (Line 430)
4. ResizeObserver only triggers when:
   - Content is actively streaming (`isStreaming = true`)
   - OR content just changed (`response !== lastResponseRef.current`)
   - NOT when window is just being moved (both conditions false)

## 🧪 TESTING GUIDE

### Setup
```bash
cd /Users/benekroetz/EVIA/EVIA-Desktop
npm run dev
```

**Important**: Run in `terminal.app` (not the app's built-in terminal) so you can see DevTools console logs.

### Test #1: Listen Window Layout (Issue #1)

**Objective**: Verify Listen appears to the LEFT of Ask when Ask is already open.

**Steps**:
1. **Open Ask window first**
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+Return` OR click "Fragen" button
   - ✅ **Verify**: Ask window appears centered under header

2. **Open Listen window while Ask is open**
   - Press `Cmd+K` OR click "Listen" button
   - ✅ **Verify**: Listen window appears to the LEFT of Ask
   - ✅ **Verify**: Both windows are visible side-by-side
   - ✅ **Verify**: No overlap or flash of windows

3. **Check Console Logs** (DevTools)
   ```
   [layoutChildWindows] 📐 ask bounds: {x: ..., y: ..., width: ..., height: ...}
   [layoutChildWindows] 📐 listen bounds: {x: ..., y: ..., width: ..., height: ...}
   ```
   - ✅ **Verify**: `listen.x` < `ask.x` (Listen is to the left)

**Expected Layout**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           [EVIA Header Bar]                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓                    ↓
┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐
│  Listen Window │    │   Ask Window   │  ← Side by side
│  (Transcript)  │    │   (Q&A)        │
└────────────────┘    └────────────────┘
```

**What to Look Out For**:
- ❌ **FAIL**: Listen appears centered (covering Ask)
- ❌ **FAIL**: Brief flash of overlap before windows separate
- ❌ **FAIL**: Ask window closes when Listen opens
- ✅ **PASS**: Smooth appearance, both visible, no overlap

### Test #2: Ask Window Resize Behavior (Issue #2)

**Objective**: Verify Ask window doesn't resize when moved with arrow keys (only when content changes).

**Steps**:

#### Part A: Generate Response (Should Resize)
1. **Ask a question**
   - Open Ask window (`Cmd+Shift+Return`)
   - Type: "What is 2+2? Explain briefly."
   - Press Enter
   - ✅ **Verify**: Window resizes as Groq response streams in

2. **Wait for completion**
   - Wait for streaming to finish (blue "Abbrechen" button disappears)
   - ✅ **Verify**: Console shows:
     ```
     [AskView] 📝 Response complete, saved for resize detection
     ```

#### Part B: Move Window (Should NOT Resize)
3. **Move header with arrow keys**
   - Use arrow keys to move the header around:
     - `←` Left
     - `→` Right
     - `↑` Up
     - `↓` Down
   - Move 10-20 times in different directions

4. **Check console logs**
   - ❌ **FAIL**: You see multiple `[AskView] 📏 ResizeObserver` logs
   - ✅ **PASS**: NO `ResizeObserver` logs (content is static)

5. **Visual check**
   - ✅ **Verify**: Ask window maintains same size while moving
   - ✅ **Verify**: No jitter or height changes
   - ✅ **Verify**: Smooth movement

#### Part C: New Response (Should Resize Again)
6. **Ask another question**
   - Type: "Now multiply that by 3"
   - Press Enter
   - ✅ **Verify**: Window resizes again as new response streams

7. **Completion check**
   - Wait for streaming to finish
   - ✅ **Verify**: Console shows response saved
   - ✅ **Verify**: `[AskView] 📏 ResizeObserver` logs appear (content changed)

8. **Move again**
   - Move header with arrow keys again
   - ✅ **Verify**: NO resize logs (static content again)

**What to Look Out For**:
- ❌ **FAIL**: ResizeObserver logs appear on EVERY arrow key press
- ❌ **FAIL**: Window height changes slightly when moving
- ❌ **FAIL**: Visual jitter during movement
- ✅ **PASS**: Resize ONLY when content streams/changes
- ✅ **PASS**: Smooth movement with static size

---

### Test #3: Combined Scenario (Both Fixes)

**Objective**: Verify both fixes work together in a realistic workflow.

**Steps**:
1. Open Ask window first
2. Ask a question and wait for response
3. Open Listen window (should appear to the left)
4. Start recording audio (Listen window shows transcript)
5. Move header around with arrow keys
6. ✅ **Verify**: Ask window doesn't resize (content is static)
7. ✅ **Verify**: Both windows maintain positions relative to header
8. Stop recording
9. Click an insight in Listen window
10. ✅ **Verify**: Ask window resizes for new response
11. Wait for completion
12. Move header again
13. ✅ **Verify**: Ask window doesn't resize (static content)

## 📊 CONSOLE LOG GUIDE

### What You Should See

#### On Window Layout:
```
[layoutChildWindows] 📐 ask bounds: {x: 800, y: 150, width: 480, height: 300}
[layoutChildWindows] 📐 listen bounds: {x: 310, y: 150, width: 480, height: 600}
```
- ✅ Listen x < Ask x (left positioning)

#### On Response Complete:
```
[AskView] ✅ Stream completed
[AskView] 📝 Response complete, saved for resize detection
```

#### On Resize (Content Changed):
```
[AskView] 📏 ResizeObserver (debounced): 300px → 450px (delta: 150px)
```
- Should ONLY appear when:
  - Response is streaming
  - Response just completed and size changed

#### On Window Move (Content Static):
```
(No resize logs should appear)
```
- ✅ Silence is golden - means resize is properly skipped

## 🔍 DEBUGGING

### If Listen Still Overlaps Ask:

1. **Check visibility state**:
   - Open DevTools for Header window
   - Console: `localStorage.getItem('overlay-state')`
   - Should show: `{"visible":{"ask":true,"listen":true}}`

2. **Check actual bounds**:
   - In console logs, find the `[layoutChildWindows] 📐` lines
   - Verify `listen.x` < `ask.x`
   - If not, there's a layout calculation bug

3. **Check window creation order**:
   - Verify `createChildWindow` is called for both
   - Verify bounds are set BEFORE `ensureVisibility`

### If Ask Keeps Resizing on Move:

1. **Check ResizeObserver logs**:
   - If you see logs during movement, the check isn't working

2. **Verify lastResponseRef**:
   - Add debug: `console.log('[DEBUG] lastResponseRef:', lastResponseRef.current, 'response:', response)`
   - They should be EQUAL after streaming completes

3. **Check isStreaming state**:
   - Add debug: `console.log('[DEBUG] isStreaming:', isStreaming)`
   - Should be `false` after streaming completes

## 📝 NOTES FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### Why These Fixes Were Needed

**Listen Layout Issue**:
- Electron's `setBounds` is synchronous, but window showing might have timing nuances
- Adding explicit logging helps verify bounds are set correctly
- Future: Consider adding integration tests for window layout

**Ask Resize Issue**:
- ResizeObserver is powerful but can be overly sensitive
- Need to distinguish "content changed" from "container reflow"
- Using refs to track last known content is a common React pattern

### Related Code to Watch

**Window Layout**:
- `layoutChildWindows()` (overlay-windows.ts:399-528)
- Handles all window positioning logic
- Uses "horizontal stack" algorithm from Glass

**Resize Logic**:
- ResizeObserver (AskView.tsx:64-112)
- Only triggers when content actually changes
- Debounced to 100ms for stability
