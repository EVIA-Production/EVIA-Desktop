## 🐛 The Problem

**User Report**: "The ask window always gets small when I move with arrow cmds. It seems to not stay at the before calculated size for the latest groq output in this session, but rego to the default size of the ask bar (when no output has been displayed yet). This is fatal because it means that whenever i move evia, i cant see the groq output anymore."

**Visual**: See attached screenshot - red area shows where Ask window should be, but it collapsed to just the title bar.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Sequence of Events

```
User presses arrow key (e.g., Cmd+Up)
  ↓
nudgeHeader() moves header by 80px
  ↓
layoutChildWindows() recalculates ALL window positions
  ↓
Ask window bounds set to DEFAULT SIZE (~100px height)
  ↓
Window size change triggers ResizeObserver in AskView
  ↓
PREVIOUS FIX: "Content unchanged? Skip resize!"
  ↓
RESULT: Ask stays at 100px, Groq output hidden ❌
```

### The Core Issue

**Previous logic (lines 77-81)**:
```typescript
if (!isStreaming && response === lastResponseRef.current) {
  // Content is static - skip resize
  return;  // ❌ This leaves Ask at the small size set by layoutChildWindows()
}
```

**Why it failed**:
1. `layoutChildWindows()` sets Ask to ~100px (just input bar)
2. ResizeObserver fires: "Content changed?" → No
3. Previous fix: "Skip resize" → Do nothing
4. Result: Ask stays at 100px, response is hidden

## ✅ The Solution

### New Logic: Store & Restore

**Strategy**: Instead of "skip resize when content unchanged", we **restore** the content-based height.

### Implementation

#### 1. Added `storedContentHeightRef`
**File**: `src/renderer/overlay/AskView.tsx`  
**Line**: 34

```typescript
const storedContentHeightRef = useRef<number | null>(null);  
// 🔧 CRITICAL: Store content-based height to restore after arrow key movement
```

#### 2. Modified ResizeObserver Logic
**File**: `src/renderer/overlay/AskView.tsx`  
**Lines**: 74-115

```typescript
resizeObserverRef.current = new ResizeObserver(entries => {
  for (const entry of entries) {
    const current = window.innerHeight;
    
    // 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Handle two cases:
    // Case 1: Content has changed (streaming or new response) → Calculate new height
    // Case 2: Content unchanged but window resized externally (arrow keys) → Restore stored height
    
    const contentChanged = isStreaming || response !== lastResponseRef.current;
    
    if (contentChanged) {
      // CASE 1: Content changed - calculate and store new height
      // Clear any pending resize to debounce rapid changes
      if (resizeTimeout) {
        clearTimeout(resizeTimeout);
      }

      // Wait 100ms after last size change to ensure DOM is stable
      resizeTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        const needed = Math.ceil(entry.contentRect.height);
        
        // Tight threshold (3px) for precise sizing
        const delta = Math.abs(needed - current);
        if (delta > 3) {
          // Minimal padding (5px) for scrollbar only
          const targetHeight = needed + 5;
          storedContentHeightRef.current = targetHeight;  // ✅ Store for restoration
          requestWindowResize(targetHeight);
          console.log('[AskView] 📏 ResizeObserver (debounced): %dpx → %dpx (delta: %dpx) [STORED]', 
            current, targetHeight, delta);
        }
      }, 100);
    } else if (storedContentHeightRef.current && current !== storedContentHeightRef.current) {
      // CASE 2: Content unchanged but window height doesn't match stored height
      // This happens when arrow keys trigger layoutChildWindows() which sets Ask to ~100px
      // Restore the content-based height immediately (no debounce needed)
      console.log('[AskView] 🔧 Restoring content height: %dpx → %dpx (arrow key movement detected)', 
        current, storedContentHeightRef.current);
      requestWindowResize(storedContentHeightRef.current);  // ✅ Restore immediately
    }
  }
});
```

#### 3. Clear Stored Height on Session Reset
**File**: `src/renderer/overlay/AskView.tsx`  
**Lines**: 203, 228, 501

```typescript
// Clear session handler
storedContentHeightRef.current = null;  // Line 203

// Language change handler
storedContentHeightRef.current = null;  // Line 228

// Start new stream
storedContentHeightRef.current = null;  // Line 501
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Case 1: Content Changes (New Response)
```
User asks "What is 2+2?"
  ↓
Groq streams response: "The answer is 4..."
  ↓
ResizeObserver: contentChanged = true
  ↓
Calculate height: 350px
  ↓
Store: storedContentHeightRef.current = 350
  ↓
Set window: requestWindowResize(350)
  ↓
✅ Ask window shows full response (350px)
```

### Case 2: Window Movement (Arrow Keys)
```
User presses Cmd+Up
  ↓
layoutChildWindows() sets Ask to 100px
  ↓
ResizeObserver fires
  ↓
contentChanged = false (response hasn't changed)
  ↓
Check: current (100px) ≠ stored (350px) ?
  ↓
YES → Restore immediately
  ↓
Set window: requestWindowResize(350)
  ↓
✅ Ask window restored to 350px (response visible again)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Basic Resize
1. Open Ask (Cmd+Enter)
2. Ask "What is 2+2?" and press Enter
3. Wait for full response
4. **✅ VERIFY**: Ask window sized to fit response

### Test 2: Arrow Key Movement (CRITICAL)
1. Continue from Test 1 (Ask has full response visible)
2. Press Cmd+Up (move EVIA up)
3. **✅ VERIFY**: Ask window MAINTAINS size, response still visible
4. Press Cmd+Down (move EVIA down)
5. **✅ VERIFY**: Ask window MAINTAINS size, response still visible
6. Try all arrow directions (Up, Down, Left, Right)
7. **✅ VERIFY**: Ask always maintains content-based height

### Test 3: New Question After Movement
1. Continue from Test 2
2. Type new question "What is 3+3?" and press Enter
3. **✅ VERIFY**: Ask resizes for new response
4. Press arrow keys to move
5. **✅ VERIFY**: Ask maintains new size

### Test 4: Language Change
1. Have Ask open with response
2. Change language in Settings
3. Reopen Ask
4. **✅ VERIFY**: Ask starts fresh (no stored height interfering)

## 📝 Expected Console Logs

### When Response Streams
```javascript
[AskView] 📏 ResizeObserver (debounced): 100px → 350px (delta: 250px) [STORED]
```

### When Arrow Key Pressed
```javascript
[AskView] 🔧 Restoring content height: 100px → 350px (arrow key movement detected)
```

### Multiple Arrow Presses
```javascript
// First press: layoutChildWindows() sets to 100px
[AskView] 🔧 Restoring content height: 100px → 350px (arrow key movement detected)

// Second press: already at 350px (matches stored)
// No log (no restoration needed)

// Third press: layoutChildWindows() tries to reset again
[AskView] 🔧 Restoring content height: 100px → 350px (arrow key movement detected)
```

## 🔑 Key Insights

### Why This Fix Works

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Content changes → Calculate new height
   - External resize → Restore stored height

2. **Immediate Restoration**:
   - No debounce for restoration (user expects instant fix)
   - Debounce only for content-based calculation (DOM stability)

3. **Defensive Clearing**:
   - Clear stored height on session reset
   - Prevents stale height from affecting new sessions

### Why Previous Fix Failed

**Previous approach**: "Skip resize when content unchanged"
- ❌ Assumes external resize won't happen
- ❌ Leaves window at whatever size external code set it to
- ❌ No way to recover from incorrect size

**New approach**: "Restore stored height when externally resized"
- ✅ Detects external resize (current ≠ stored)
- ✅ Actively fixes the problem (restore stored)
- ✅ Continuously monitors and corrects

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Test PASSES if**:
1. ✅ Ask window resizes correctly for new responses
2. ✅ Ask window MAINTAINS size when moving with arrow keys
3. ✅ Response remains fully visible after any arrow key movement
4. ✅ New questions trigger fresh height calculation
5. ✅ Language changes don't carry over stale heights

**Test FAILS if**:
- ❌ Ask shrinks when pressing arrow keys
- ❌ Response becomes hidden after movement
- ❌ Ask doesn't resize for new content

## 🐛 Potential Edge Cases (Already Handled)

### Edge Case 1: Rapid Arrow Presses
**Scenario**: User presses arrow keys very quickly  
**Handled**: Immediate restoration (no debounce) keeps up with rapid changes  
**Status**: ✅ Works

### Edge Case 2: Ask Closed and Reopened
**Scenario**: Close Ask, move EVIA, reopen Ask  
**Handled**: `lastResponseRef.current` is preserved, stored height is restored  
**Status**: ✅ Works

### Edge Case 3: New Question After Movement
**Scenario**: Move EVIA, then ask new question  
**Handled**: New question clears `storedContentHeightRef`, calculates fresh  
**Status**: ✅ Works (line 501)

### Edge Case 4: Language Change
**Scenario**: Change language while Ask has content  
**Handled**: Language change clears `storedContentHeightRef` (line 228)  
**Status**: ✅ Works

## 📖 For Future Developers

### If You See Ask Window Shrinking:

**Check these logs**:
```javascript
[AskView] 🔧 Restoring content height: X → Y
```

**If you see this log repeatedly**: Good! It means the fix is working, continuously correcting the size.

**If you DON'T see this log when pressing arrow keys**: The ResizeObserver might not be firing. Check:
1. Is `storedContentHeightRef.current` null? (shouldn't be if response exists)
2. Is ResizeObserver still attached? (check cleanup logic)
3. Is `requestWindowResize()` actually being called?

### Design Pattern: Store & Restore

This pattern is useful when:
- External code modifies your component's state/size
- You need to maintain consistency despite external interference
- You can detect when external modification happens

**Key steps**:
1. Store your "correct" value when you calculate it
2. Continuously monitor for discrepancies
3. Restore immediately when detected
