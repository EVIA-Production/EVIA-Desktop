# 🚀 READY TO TEST - Final Fix Applied!

## ✅ What I Fixed

**The Problem:** Both Header and Listen windows created separate WebSocket connections, but backend only sent messages to Header window (which had 0 handlers), so transcripts were lost.

**The Solution:** Header window now **forwards ALL transcript messages** to Listen window via **Electron IPC**.

---

## 🎯 Test Now (2 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Restart Electron

In your Electron terminal, press **Ctrl+C**, then:

```bash
EVIA_DEV=1 npm run dev:main
```

**Keep Vite running in the other terminal!**

---

### Step 2: Test Transcription

1. Click **"Zuhören"** button
2. **Speak**: "Hey, what's up? How are you?"
3. **Watch Listen window**: Transcripts should appear! 🎉

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Listen Window Console (NEW LOGS):
```
[ListenView] ✅ IPC listener registered
[ListenView] 📨 Received IPC message: transcript_segment
[ListenView] 📨 IPC Adding transcript: Hey, what's up? final: false
[IPC State Debug] Updated transcripts count: 2 Latest: Hey, what's up?
```

### Header Window Console (NEW LOGS):
```
[AudioCapture] Forwarding message to Listen window: transcript_segment
[AudioCapture] Forwarding message to Listen window: status
```

### Listen Window Display:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  EVIA hört zu    00:15          │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  ○ EVIA Connection OK           │  ← Initial
│  ○ Hey, what's up?              │  ← YOUR SPEECH! ✅
│  ○ How are you?                 │  ← WORKING! ✅
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- [ ] Listen window shows **real-time transcripts** as you speak
- [ ] **Both interim and final** transcripts appear
- [ ] Timer shows **session duration**
- [ ] No more "EVIA connection OK" only

**If all checked: TRANSCRIPTION IS FULLY WORKING!** 🚀🎉

---

## 🔧 Quick Debugging

### If transcripts don't appear:

**1. Check IPC is working:**

In Header DevTools:
```javascript
window.evia.ipc.send('transcript-message', { 
  type: 'transcript_segment', 
  data: { text: 'Test', speaker: 1, is_final: false }
})
```

Look in **Listen DevTools** for:
```
[ListenView] 📨 Received IPC message: transcript_segment
```

**2. Check forwarding:**

Look in **Header console** for:
```
[AudioCapture] Forwarding message to Listen window: ...
```

If you see this, the fix is working! ✅
