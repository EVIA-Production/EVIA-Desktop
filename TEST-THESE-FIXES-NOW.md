## 🐛 If Something Fails

### Test 2 Fails (Listen disappears)
**Check Console**:
```javascript
// Should see:
[overlay-windows] toggleWindow('ask'): ask=true, preserving listen=true
```

**If you see `preserving listen=false`**: Listen wasn't actually visible  
**Fix**: Make sure Listen is open BEFORE pressing Cmd+Enter

---

### Test 3 Fails (Ask not cleared)
**Check Console** (Ask window DevTools):
```javascript
// Should see:
[AskView] 🌐 Language changed to en - clearing all state
[AskView] ✅ State cleared due to language change
```

**If missing**: IPC event not reaching AskView  
**Debug**: Check overlay-entry.tsx is sending `language-changed`

---

### Test 4 Fails (Input not focused)
**Check Console** (Ask window DevTools):
```javascript
// Should see:
[AskView] ⌨️ Auto-focused input (attempt 1)
// Maybe also:
[AskView] ⚠️ Focus failed, retrying...
[AskView] ⌨️ Auto-focused input (attempt 2)
```

**If you see retry**: Focus worked on 2nd attempt (this is OK)  
**If DevTools open**: Close DevTools and try again (DevTools steals focus)

---

### Test 5 Fails (Insights not cleared)
**Check Console** (Listen window DevTools):
```javascript
// Should see:
[ListenView] 🌐 Language changed to en - clearing insights
[ListenView] ✅ Insights cleared for new language
```

**If missing**: IPC event not reaching ListenView  
**Debug**: Check overlay-entry.tsx is sending `language-changed`
